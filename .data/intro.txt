------------------------THE MAZE--------------------

Welcome to the Maze, where every step you take is a step deeper into the unknown.
The path twists and turns, but only the truly courageous can navigate its traps and illusions.
The exit is out there... but will you find it before it claims you?


Your goal is to go from B (the beginning) to F (the finishline).
To achieve this goal you must change the authorizations of the files up, right, left and down to be able to move.
Once a direction is authorized, you keeps moving until you take action to turn or stop.
Good luck !!!
